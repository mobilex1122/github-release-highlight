# Github Release Highlight

Extension that helps you find relases that are for your device.

## Download

Curently the only way to download this extension is from Releases as we are not yet on Chrome Store (budget constrains [consider supporting me](https://janp.cz/patreon)).

## What can it do right now?

- Highlight Relases
- Select presets from ui
- Set custom presets (experimantal)

## FAQ

### Firefox?

This extension is not made for firefox but do to the nature of the Extension system it should theoreticaly work on firefox.

### Is it offline?

Yes! All presets and processing is done on YOUR computer. This extension will never require internet to work.

### What sites are supported?

Github only. Might add more sites if people demand it but it's not planned.

### Does this track me?

No. Check source code it's open. :)


## What to improve (aka what I need help with)

- Better preset storage (better structure of the JSON file)
- More options (Split some options into multiple ones for better administration)
- Overall improvement on the site script (How it parses code)
